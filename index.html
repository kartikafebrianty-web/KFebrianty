    <h1 class="main-header">Cats are my favourite animals</h1>
    <p>Cats are a popular pet. Many people have them as a companion friend for their house. They are playful, love to be cuddled and very independent at the same time. In our home, we have a cat that we were adopted since she was a kitten. She is a black and white cat. She loves to play with a furry little ball. We love spending time with her, although her favourite thing is sleeping under a blanket all day. </p>
